## Welcome, weary traveler

What can I tell you? I am a hobbyist coder and translator, most of things I do or put on the GitHub revolve around the [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2).

_Answers to some of the points suggested by the GitHub to be filled on the personal readme:_

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently: [maintaining OpenRCT2 cs-CZ localisation](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/Localisation?tab=readme-ov-file#language-status) (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ [Czech ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language)), working on OpenRCT2 plugin [Measuring Tape](https://github.com/tygrysek90/OpenRCT2-Measuring-Tape)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: TypeScript and C++ _(and I can leave this sentence here forever, as learning is never-ending process)_
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: if you have a plugin idea and don't know how to make it live, ring me up (writing is also fine :wink:)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything you want :smile:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I hang on OpenRCT2 discord channel, you can catch me in #plugin or #off-topic or via DM (direct message)
